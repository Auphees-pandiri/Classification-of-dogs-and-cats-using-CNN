# Classification-of-dogs-and-cats-using-CNN
Convolutional neural networks are similar to Artificial neural networks.Images are the input for the cnn. In convolution neural networks there are 4 layers. They are i)Convolution ii)Pooling iii)Flattening iv)Fully connected layer.In this project I have classified the dogs and cats images using CNN. I have created all the layers using keras and then trained the model on the data and then I find the accuracy of the model. I have almost got 85% accuracy.
